# Custom STM Design

This is a README file for the custom-stm-design PCB board, a versatile and powerful board that features the STM32F405 MCU. This board can handle a wide range of applications, thanks to its rich set of peripherals and interfaces. 

The board supports power supply from +12V, using a buck converter to regulate the voltage for the MCU and other components. It also supports USB power and data, allowing you to connect the board to your computer or other devices. You can use the USB interface to program, debug, or communicate with the board.

The board also provides UART and I2C interfaces, which are useful for serial communication with sensors, actuators, or other boards. You can use these interfaces to expand the functionality of your board or integrate it with other systems.

Finally, the board supports SWD debugging, which is a low-pin-count interface that allows you to access the core features of the MCU. You can use SWD debugging to monitor, control, or modify the behavior of your board in real time.

The custom-stm-design PCB board is a great choice for anyone who wants to explore the capabilities of the STM32F405 MCU or create their own projects using this powerful and flexible platform. You can find more information about the board specifications, schematics, and firmware in the following sections.
